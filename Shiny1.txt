The R Shiny package is a great way for interactively showcasing and sharing statistical analyses and results performed and generated in R on the web. 

The shiny package is a powerful tool for statisticians and data analysts who wish to share their work in an interactive fashion.

An R Shiny app consists of two scripts, ui.R and server.R, the user-interface and server-side scripts, respectively, as well as any data or other files that may be needed by the app, depending on its complexity.

\frametitle{Shiny : Easy web applications in R}

Shiny makes it super simple for R users like you to turn analyses into interactive web 
applications that anyone can use. Let your users choose input parameters using friendly 
controls like sliders, drop-downs, and text fields. Easily incorporate any number 
of outputs like plots, tables, and summaries.

No HTML or JavaScript knowledge is necessary. If you have some experience with R, 
youâ€™re just minutes away from combining the statistical power of R with the 
simplicity of a web page.
